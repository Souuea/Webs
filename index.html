					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am 18 years old and recently completed Year 12 at Balgowlah Boys. I'm from New Zealand and thoroughly enjoy the career I have in gaming and love to stream on twitch. I have a cat named Lulu along with a dog named Bella, and my favourite dish is Tiropita, a Greek-style cheese pie that I grew up eating because my father’s background is Greek.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT stems from attending a UTS work experience course when I was 14, where I was shown how important IT security is additionally one of the lecturers demonstrated his attempt to hack through a company’s secure firewall and try to steal critical information, after his hack is complete he then goes back and explains to them how he achieved it so they can better their own security. He also helps construct systems and firewalls that are nearly impenetrable.</p>

<p>To me IT is the future, I believe there will be an almost endless amount of career opportunities if you are within the IT industry. Personally, I would like to have a career in cyber security as I love problem-solving and challenging myself.</p>

<p>After looking at all the courses available within each university I concluded that the course at RMIT “Introduction to Information Technology” was perfect. I am hoping that during or after my studies I will be able to pursue a more defined path within IT, after all, I would like to find a job in cyber security but I may find other areas of interest after familiarizing myself with more of the industry.</p>

				<ul class="Ideal Hobby">
					
					<p>I have always enjoyed gaming since I was a child, and now that I am a teen, I am able to pursue it as a career.

					<h2>Test 1</h2>
					<h3>Learning Styles Quiz</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>In the Learning Styles Quiz, I scored the highest in the Pragmatist style. “Pragmatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work. They may act quickly and confidently on ideas, get straight to the point, and may lose patience with lengthy discussions.”</p>
					<h2>Test 2</h2>
					<h3>Bing 5 Factors</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>In the Bing 5 Factor test, I scored the highest in Conscientiousness,” Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and diligent.”</p>
					<h2>Test 3</h2>
					<h3>Myers-Briggs test</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>Type: Protagonist</p>
					<p>Code: ENFJ-A / ENFJ-T</p>
					<p>Roles: Diplomats</p>
					<p>Strategies: Social Engagement</p>
					<p></p>

<p>I believe the results of these tests seem quite accurate, most of the things said about my personality I can relate to, as such I believe that this will have no negative effect on my behaviour within a team, and while contemplating at forming a team I will have to take into account the variety of personalities and views that will be different from my own.</p>

<p>I must keep in mind that conflict is inevitable at some point there is going to be a disagreement. Based on my personality strengths being Reliable, Passionate, Altruistic, Receptive along with Charismatic and my personality weaknesses being Unrealistic, Overly Idealistic, Condescending, Intense and Overly Empathetic, I can see a posable conflict arising with people that are more narrow-minded, what I mean by that is they see a goal and won’t adapt to changes very well, in order to mitigate and reduce the risk of that conflict occurring I just have to find another teammate that has a comforting personality that can act as the middleman this is one of many possible steps that I am going to take in order to reduce all disagreements, in the event that a conflict unforeseen does occur regardless as a protagonist I will fill the role of the leader and try my best to resolve the conflict.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>For my IT project idea, I intend to create a game sharing product that enables you to share your games with your friends and family. This Product would include elements such as a website, online advertising, downloadable software, and gaming accessories. The aim and purpose of this Product are to be able to share paid games without each person having to pay for the game. The target audience for this gaming app is teenagers to young adults.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>I don’t necessarily have any Motivation that made me want to produce this product, but I have always wanted to be able to share the games I have paid for. Unfortunately, there is no platform that can store all games from multiple companies, my goal is to make it possible to store and share games from multiple platforms.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>The purpose of this Product is to be able to share paid games without each person having to pay for the game. I would like to have this product available for everyone who would like it, in the future I would think of evolving it from downloadable software to a sellable hard drive. At this time once you have downloaded the software you will be given the option to create an account after you have done that you will be given the option to join a party or create one, keep in mind you can only create or join one party. When that is done you will be given the option to a free version of the product which holds up to 1 game and can be shared between 2 people, you will also be given a 30 day trial for the full version, this enables you to be able to store up to 30 games and share it between 20 friends, after the 30 days it will cost $50, also keep in mind you will only be able to share your games, and only other people with the full version can access more than 1 game, along with the paid version you can order an additional little hard drive that enables faster and more storage for your games. </p>

				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Availability To Product</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>I will be creating a website where you will be able to download the app and software needed. There is also an offline option for the full version that enables you to download offline games and be able to play them offline. This website will also have a list of all the parties you will be able to join (unless you are creating one) this means you can find a party with all the games you want and apply to join, the leader of the party has the power and can either accept you or not. Also on the website, there will be all the information you need and a 24hr communications service if you are having any troubles.</P>
					<p></p>

					<p>When / if you purchase the full version you will see that you can also purchase a hard drive, this will enable you to be able to run the games you play faster and also can store the games on in if you want to free up some space on your device, tho it will be an additional $40.</p>
