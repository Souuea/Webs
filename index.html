					<h1>Personal Information</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am 18 years old and recently completed Year 12 at Balgowlah Boys. I'm from New Zealand and thoroughly enjoy the career I have in gaming and love to stream on twitch. I have a cat named Lulu along with a dog named Bella, and my favourite dish is Tiropita, a Greek-style cheese pie that I grew up eating because my father’s background is Greek.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT stems from attending a UTS work experience course when I was 14, where I was shown how important IT security is additionally one of the lecturers demonstrated his attempt to hack through a company’s secure firewall and try to steal critical information, after his hack is complete he then goes back and explains to them how he achieved it so they can better their own security. He also helps construct systems and firewalls that are nearly impenetrable.</p>

<p>To me IT is the future, I believe there will be an almost endless amount of career opportunities if you are within the IT industry. Personally, I would like to have a career in cyber security as I love problem-solving and challenging myself.</p>

<p>After looking at all the courses available within each university I concluded that the course at RMIT “Introduction to Information Technology” was perfect. I am hoping that during or after my studies I will be able to pursue a more defined path within IT, after all, I would like to find a job in cyber security but I may find other areas of interest after familiarizing myself with more of the industry.</p>

					<h2>Test 1</h2>
					<h3>Learning Styles Quiz</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>In the Learning Styles Quiz, I scored the highest in the Pragmatist style. “Pragmatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work. They may act quickly and confidently on ideas, get straight to the point, and may lose patience with lengthy discussions.”</p>
					<h2>Test 2</h2>
					<h3>Bing 5 Factors</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>In the Bing 5 Factor test, I scored the highest in Conscientiousness,” Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and diligent.”</p>
					<h2>Test 3</h2>
					<h3>Myers-Briggs test</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>Type: Protagonist</p>
					<p>Code: ENFJ-A / ENFJ-T</p>
					<p>Roles: Diplomats</p>
					<p>Strategies: Social Engagement</p>
					<p></p>

<p>I believe the results of these tests seem quite accurate, most of the things said about my personality I can relate to, as such I believe that this will have no negative effect on my behaviour within a team, and while contemplating at forming a team I will have to take into account the variety of personalities and views that will be different from my own.</p>

<p>I must keep in mind that conflict is inevitable at some point there is going to be a disagreement. Based on my personality strengths being Reliable, Passionate, Altruistic, Receptive along with Charismatic and my personality weaknesses being Unrealistic, Overly Idealistic, Condescending, Intense and Overly Empathetic, I can see a posable conflict arising with people that are more narrow-minded, what I mean by that is they see a goal and won’t adapt to changes very well, in order to mitigate and reduce the risk of that conflict occurring I just have to find another teammate that has a comforting personality that can act as the middleman this is one of many possible steps that I am going to take in order to reduce all disagreements, in the event that a conflict unforeseen does occur regardless as a protagonist I will fill the role of the leader and try my best to resolve the conflict.</p>
